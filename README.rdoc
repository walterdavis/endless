== README

Demonstrates a combination of paging and lazy-loading to show ~20K versioned objects in a single page. 

* Uses Kaminari to page the objects by 25s
* Uses a tail-call Ajax load scheme to request the next 25 after the first has loaded
* Also shows scroll-driven lazy-loading, just because
* Also shows a caching scheme that allows versions to be shown without loading all of them at once
